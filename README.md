# Post Install Configuration

This project aims to provide a generic and distro-agnostic post installation system configuration mechanism via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)

As of now the, script provides a very basic installation configuration for Arch family of distros.

Support for more distros as well as more packages is planned.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
